- Goal:
We have 6 categories (Chores, Productivity, Body activity, Self care, Nutrition, Relationships) for which we want to generate tasks daily.
This generation depends on 2 things:
1- The day of the week
2- A variable number of tasks to generate (which depends on the day)

1- Start by detecting the day.
2- Have a Json instead of a database to start with. (For read-only)


Game plan:
-----------
- Have 1 case class for categories, and 1 for activities
- Need to initialize the categories with all the activities (activities are stored in a database).
- Need to generate the todo based on the quota of every category.


Goal for next session:
----------------------
1- Convert the frequency on a task to whether it is concerned for a generation or not
2- Implement the task generation method for categories.
3- Find a way to remove the ugly side-effect
4- Unit testing for new features + the activities setting
