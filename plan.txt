- Goal:
We have 6 categories (Chores, Productivity, Body activity, Self care, Nutrition, Relationships) for which we want to generate tasks daily.
This generation depends on 2 things:
1- The day of the week
2- A variable number of tasks to generate (which depends on the day)

1- Start by detecting the day.
2- Have a Json instead of a database to start with. (For read-only)


Game plan:
-----------
- Have 1 case class for categories, and 1 for activities
- Need to initialize the categories with all the activities (activities are stored in a database).
- Need to generate the todo based on the quota of every category.


Goal for today:
---------------
1- Be able to retrieve the day
2- Create both classes with their respective methods
3- Add unit tests
