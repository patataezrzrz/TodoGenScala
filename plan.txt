- Goal:
We have 6 categories (Chores, Productivity, Body activity, Self care, Nutrition, Relationships) for which we want to generate tasks daily.
This generation depends on 2 things:
1- The day of the week
2- A variable number of tasks to generate (which depends on the day)

1- Start by detecting the day.
2- Have a Json instead of a database to start with. (For read-only)

Remaining tasks:
----------------
- Need to have the activities in a database
- Need to be able to permanently add activities to said database
- Need to be able to send http requests to the front.
- Need to dockerize the backend
